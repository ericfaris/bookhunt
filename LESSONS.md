- 2026-09-19: After deploying a frontend fix, an already-open tab can keep
  running the old `app.js` even though the SW is network-first for the shell
  — network-first only helps on the *next* navigation/fetch, not a tab that's
  already loaded and just sitting there. A "still seeing the bug" report
  right after a deploy is often just this — ask for a hard refresh
  (Ctrl+Shift+R) before assuming the fix didn't ship. Confirmed here by
  `docker exec`-grepping the deployed container's `public/app.js` for the fix
  before concluding it was a stale-tab issue, not a bad deploy.
